Introduction To Semantics

Semantics : 
    1) It is the study of meaning.
    2) It takes about the relationship between two entities/triples.
    3) The universal framework for semantics is Resource Description Framework(RDF).
    4) (Triples) are easy to share and easy to combine because each triple is atomic.
    5) Semantics also has a standard query language as SPARQL. Specifically designed for triples data.
        
        Eg : France --isA--> Country

Semantics in Marklogic :
    1) search doucments along with triples.
    2) semantic triples are used to create meaningful relationship among content.

    Eg: System A (ID) ----(sameAs)----> System B (ID)
